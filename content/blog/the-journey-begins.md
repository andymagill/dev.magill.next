You might not believe it, but my life as a Web Engineer and Lead developer is an incredible adventure. It's exactly like being Indiana Jones, but I deal with browsers and code instead of whips and treasure. That means dodging the blades of cutting edge technology, navigating the machiavellian world of marketing vendors, and battling the relentless hordes of frontend frameworks.

### It's About Time

For a long time, I've been hesitant to write publicly about my professional experiences. I was afraid of failing to reaching an audience, and too busy/lazy to change my regular routine, or work toward a goal I wasn't optimistic about. But as I plan what I want to do in the future, I've realized the importance of communicating outwardly about my projects, and the value in sharing my professional "adventures". I hope this blog will help me meet new professionals and learn about interesting opportunities.

### Fortune and Glory, Kid

Are you ready to embark on this exciting adventure with me? Let's explore uncharted territories, conquer coding challenges, and discover hidden gems in the vast world of web development. Think of me as your trusty guide, leading you through the winding paths of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. I will write about projects I'm working on, new methods I've learned, and the occasional hot-take or unpopular opinion. I will do my best to earn the time you spend here.
