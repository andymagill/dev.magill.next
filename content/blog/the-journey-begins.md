You might not believe it, but my life as a Web Engineer and Lead developer is an incredible adventure. It's exactly like being Indiana Jones, but I deal with browsers and code instead of whips and treasure. That means dodging the blades of cutting edge technology, navigating the machiavellian world of marketing vendors, and battling the relentless hordes of frontend frameworks.  

### About time you showed up

For a long time, I've been hesitant to write publically about my professional experiences. I didn't want spend time failing to reaching an audience or add a new chore to my regular routine. But as I've reflected on my career, I've since realized that there's a lot of value in sharing my professional "adventures". I hope this blog will help me meet new professionals and learn about interesting opportunities. 

### Fortune and Glory, Kid

Are you ready to embark on this exciting adventure with me? Let's explore uncharted territories, conquer coding challenges, and discover hidden gems in the vast world of web development.
