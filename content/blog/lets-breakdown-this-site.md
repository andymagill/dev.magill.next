When building my personal blog, I aimed for a fast, efficient, and maintainable platform. To achieve this, I carefully selected a combination of popular technologies and methodologies. Let's dive into the tech stack that powers my blog.

### Frameworks

-   **React:** As a versatile and component-based library, React provides a solid foundation for building dynamic user interfaces. Its declarative syntax and efficient virtual DOM make it a great choice for creating interactive web applications.
-   **Next.js:** Built on top of React, Next.js offers a full-featured framework with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and hybrid rendering. This flexibility allows me to optimize performance based on specific content requirements.

### Styling & Content

-   **SASS:** Sass is a powerful CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins. It helps me write cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets.
-   **CSS Modules:** By using CSS modules, I can avoid global namespace collisions and write more modular and reusable styles. This ensures that my styles are scoped to specific components, preventing unintended styling conflicts.
-   **Markdown:** Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to write and read. I use Markdown files to store my blog content, allowing me to focus on writing without worrying about HTML formatting.

### Developer Experience

-   **TypeScript:** TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making my code more robust and easier to maintain. It helps catch potential errors early in the development process.
-   **ESLint:** ESLint is a linter that helps me enforce coding standards and identify potential issues in my JavaScript code.
-   **Prettier:** Prettier automatically formats my code according to a consistent style, ensuring that my codebase remains clean and readable.
-   **Vitest:** Vitest is a fast unit testing framework that integrates seamlessly with my Next.js project. It helps me write tests to ensure the quality and reliability of my code.

### What was I thinking?

By carefully selecting and combining these technologies and methods, I've created a blog that is fast, scalable, and easy to maintain. This tech stack provides a solid foundation for future growth and allows me to focus on creating high-quality content.
