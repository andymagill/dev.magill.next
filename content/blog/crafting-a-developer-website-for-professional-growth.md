A professional website has become a tried-and-true method for developers and engineers to showcase their skills and experience. When [building my website](/post/lets-breakdown-this-website), I thought it could be a worthy exercise to examine what makes a great professional website. There are endless examples of beautiful portfolios, and informative weblogs to offer insight and inspiration, but what's really interesting for employers and clients?

In a competitive job market, a strong portfolio can be your secret sauce. It's like a digital handshake, introducing you to potential employers and clients before even meeting them. Unlike a traditional resume, a portfolio lets you showcase your skills and experience in a dynamic, visual way. A polished, engaging portfolio can lead to all kinds of professional opportunities: job offers, consulting work, or freelance gigs. It's your chance to control the story of who you are as a developer and why people should want to work with you.

### Show Growth, Not Projects

A good professional website should not just show your best projects in a portfolio format, it's also about sharing your thought process and how you tackle challenges. **[Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/blog/write-learn/)**, an Engineering Manager at Google, talks about how highlighting what you learned to set you apart: _"The practice of writing about learning encourages a growth mindset. It fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and a willingness to engage with challenging subjects."_ He suggests including details about the obstacles you faced, and how you solved them. This way, you're not just showcasing your coding skills; you're also highlighting your critical thinking and adaptability in your published work and previous experiences.

### Storytelling And Your Personal Brand

A professional blog is your chance to tell your story—think of it as your origin story, minus the radioactive spider bite. It's where your projects, creativity, and personality collide. As **[Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/write-on-your-own-website/)**, creator of [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), writes: _"Writing on your own website associates your thoughts and ideas with you as a person."_ A great professional blog shows how you think, how you solve problems, and why you're the kind of developer people want to collaborate with.

### The Self-Closing Tag

Your website should reflect your journey as a developer. As you build and maintain it, focus on incorporating current trends, addressing relevant challenges, and telling your unique story. With a thoughtful approach, your portfolio can become a powerful tool in showcasing not just what you do, but how well you can do it.

These ideas, along with the resources below helped shape my thoughts on how I would build [my website](/) and [work portfolio](/projects).
