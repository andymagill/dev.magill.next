For too long, I defaulted to arrays and objects for most lists in JavaScript, they work and they're familiar. But sticking with arrays out of habit meant I was missing out on the advantages that Sets can provide. Looking deeper, I realized sets can make your code faster and easier to read, especially when you need unique values. Here are some practical benefits: 

### Uniqueness

Arrays allow duplicates, which means you may need extra logic to handle repeat values. Sets on the other hand, guarantee that every value is uniqueâ€”no manual steps for de-duplication are necessary. 

```js
const arr = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple'];
const uniqueArr = [...new Set(arr)]; // [ 'apple', 'banana' ]

const tags = new Set(['apple', 'banana', 'apple']);
console.log([...tags]); // [ 'apple', 'banana' ]
```

### Easy Existence Checks

Checking if a value exists in an array (`arr.includes(value)`) is a linear operation that traverses and examines values, which can be slow for large lists. Sets use a hash-based structure, so lookup with `.has(value)` [is much quicker](https://github.com/anvaka/set-vs-object).

### Iteration

Iterating over a Set is just as easy as iterating over an array, but you're guaranteed to only see unique values.

```js
const uniqueTags = new Set(['js', 'es6', 'js']);
for (const tag of uniqueTags) {
  console.log(tag); // 'js', 'es6'
}
```

## The Closing Tag

In practice, Sets are a useful upgrade over traditional arrays when you need unique values, fast lookups, and cleaner logic. They help you write code that's not only more efficient, but also easier to understand and maintain. Sets won't make you a better person or whiten your teeth, but they might help improve your code and skillset.
