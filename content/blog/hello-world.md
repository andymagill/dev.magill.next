# Hello World!
Welcome to my first blog post! I'll be honest, this is really just a test of my Next.JS application to successfully generate and publish a static website.  If you are reading this, the test is a success. Hooray!

## What are you talking about ?
I created this blog to showcase my best work, discuss new technology trends, and share any insights I've learned along the way. I've avoided this kind of activity for too long and that attitude has caught up with me. I'll do my best to earn the time you spend here.

For now, let's just test a code block : 
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```
