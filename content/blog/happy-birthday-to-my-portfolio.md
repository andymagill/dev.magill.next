Happy Birthday, my dear Website! Today is a big day for you as we celebrate your re-launch, and I can’t help but feel proud of how far we’ve come together.

Thinking back on our journey, I'm reminded about how objectively bad you were. Water is under the bridge and I've forgiven you. Those outdated designs were like a bad hair day from the 90's. But through all that, I learned a ton about software engineering and what it takes to turn a bad website into a good one.

What makes me proud is the hurculean effort that went into bringing you back to life. I’ve carefully considered [every detail](/post/lets-breakdown-this-site) to make sure you reflect not just my work but also my growth as a creator. I’m committed to spending more quality time with you, writing [meaningful blog posts](/blog) and adding features that genuinely are useful (unlike this post). It feels a bit like gardening, and I hope this will grow.

### Our Future Together

Looking ahead, I’m excited about what we’ll do together. I can already imagine [the cool projects](projects) we’ll develop and the insights we’ll share. I want this space to inspire others and create connections, and you are critically important for that effort.

So here’s to you, Website, old pal! May this birthday kick off a new adventure filled with creativity and opportunities. I can’t wait to see where this crazy journey takes us!
